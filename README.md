> This project is an example with two implementations of how to combine hard coded language files with dynamically loaded ones.
> Checkout (pun intended) the `pass_setterFunc_implementation` (this is now master as well) branch for one and the `redux_implementation` branch for the other.
> See the forked repo for the original code that handles static translation files only.
